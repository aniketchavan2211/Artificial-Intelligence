- Python was created by Guido Rossum in 1989 and is very easy to learn.

- Simple and Easy to Learn - Python is a simple and easy to learn, read & write
- Free and Open Source - Python is an example of a FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) which means one can freely distribute copies of this software, reads it's source code, modify it, etc.
- High-Level Language - One does not need to bother about the low-level details like memory allocations, etc. while writing Python script.
- Portable - Supported by many platforms like Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, BeOS, OS/390, PlayStation, Windows CE, etc.
- Supports different Programming Paradigm - Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming.
- Extensible - Python code can invoke C and C++ libraries, can be called from and C++ programs, can integrate with Java and .NET components.

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is subset of AI, AI learned pattern from ML from given dataset, it draws a pattern from it.

## Need for Machine Learning

"***"Over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every single day, and it's only going to grow from there. By 2020, it's estimated that 1.7 MB of data will be created every seconds for every person on earth."***

- Cloud Data
- Internet Of Things
- Social Media

- Increase in Data Generation
- Improve Decision Making
- Uncovers patterns & trends in data
- Solve Complex Problems

## What is Machine Learning ?

Arthur Samuel first coined the term Machine Learning in the year 1959.

**What is Machine Learning**
>"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

A simpler definition of Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ), which provides machines the ability to learn automatically & improve from experience without being explicitly  programmed.

Feed Data -> Training the Machine ->  Build a Model ->  Predicting Outcome

## Machine Learning Definitions

**Algorithm:** A set of rules and statistical techniques used to learn pattern from data.

**Model:** A model is trained by using a Machine Learning Algorithm.

**Predictor Variable:** It is a feature(s) of the data that can be used to predict the output.

**Response Variable:** It is a the feature or the output variable ( target variable ) that needs to be predicted by using the predictor variable(s).

**Training Data:** The Machine Learning model is built using the training data.

**Testing Data:** The Machine Learning model is evaluated using the testing data.

## Machine Learning Process

Steps to follow:
- Define Objectives 
- Data Gathering
- Preparing Data
- Data Exploration
- Building a Model
- Model Evaluation
- Predictions

**Machine Learning Process**
> The Machine Learning process involves building a **Predictive model** that can be used to find a **solution** for **Problem Statement**.

==Explain with an Example:==

**Step 1: Define the objective of the Problem**
> To predict the possibility of rain by studying the weather conditions.

- What are we trying to predict? -> ( Continuous variable or Discrete variable )
- What are the target features? 
- What is the input data?
- What kind of problems we are facing? Binary classification ? Clustering ? Regression Problem ?

**Step 2: Data Gathering**
> Data such as weather conditions, humidity level, temperature, pressure, etc are either collected manually or scarped from web.

**Step 3: Preparing Data
> Data Cleaning involves getting rid of inconsistencies in data such as missing values or redundant variables.

- Transforms data into desired format
- Data Cleaning
	- Missing values
	- Corrupted data
	- Remove unnecessary data

**Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis**
> Data Exploration involves understanding the patterns and trends in the data. At this stage all the useful insights are drawn and correlations between the variables are understood.

**Step 5: Building a Machine Learning Model**
>At this stage a Predictive Model is built by using Machine Learning Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.

Split data into two parts: training  data (80%) & testing data. (20%).

- Machine Learning model is built by using the training data set.
- The model is the Machine Learning algorithms that predicts the output by using the data fed to it.

**Step 6: Model Evaluation & Optimization**
>The efficiency of the model is evaluated and any further improvement in the model are implemented.

- Machine Learning model is evaluated by using the testing data set.
- The accuracy of the model is calculated.
- Further improvement in the model are done by using techniques like Parameter tuning.

**Step 7: Predictions**
> The final outcome is predicted after performing parameter tuning and improving the accuracy of the model.

## Types Of Machine Learning 

- Supervised Learning 
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

### Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning is a technique in which we teach or train the machine using data which is well labelled.

Labelled data -> ML Algorithms -> classes of labelled data

You have well labelled dataset, take an example Tom & Jerry, You feed Tom and Jerry how they looks and basis on that Algorithm will classify or separate them forming class of Tom contains tom data and class jerry contains jerry data.
### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is unlabelled and allowing the algorithms to act on that information without guidance.

Unlabelled data -> ML  Algorithms -> Clusters formed on features

Take previous example of Tom & Jerry, In Unsupervised learning data is unlabelled, on building model, model will identify features as of Big Ears, skins etc, on basis of that data, it output as grouping the type a and type b , clustering basis on features on type a and type b,  Compare appearance both of them - Tom & Jerry.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a part of Machine learning where an agent is put in an environment and he learns to behave in this environment by performing certain actions and observing the rewards which it gets from those actions.

In Reinforcement Learning , we don't give data, we put Agent AI, in a environment, and Agent AI had to explore, without knowing anything of it's environment, on basis of actions it gets rewards or  punishment, AI learn will learn which things to do and not to do.
